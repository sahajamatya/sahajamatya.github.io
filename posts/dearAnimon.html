            Dearest Animon,
        </p>
        <p>
            Often times when we delve into our conversations, I find it hard to articulate what I really mean to say.
            Maybe it is because I am not so used to bringing my thoughts into existence through verbal communication,
            I’ve never had the pleasure of doing so verbally without being told to shut up. I find it more effective
            when I am sitting down with a piece of paper, so this is my sincere effort to re-clarify the things I would
            like you to understand. The things I say to you are an amalgamation of what I’ve spent my past years
            learning through various books and other sources, it has been quite a while since the last time I engaged in
            such a learning adventure, so I embarked upon it again to give you a more informed and well-constructed
            discourse.
        </p>
        <p>
            I talked to you about pain and suffering, and how we should take responsibility to give enough meaning to it
            so as to justify its cause. We ought not to let the pain we’ve endured be for no reason. We must act to
            forge it so that we can benefit from it, in the exact same way blacksmiths forge iron into the shapes they
            want. Let us look at mythology. It is no accident that the individual western culture looks up to most was
            someone unfairly nailed to a cross and tortured, someone who went through immense pain and suffering. I am
            talking about Jesus Christ. It makes perfect sense.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is always a reason to be resentful about your existence, and you can always act it out and make it
            infinitely worse. The idea that hell is a bottomless pit is no accident either. No matter how bad hell is,
            you can always figure out a way to make it even worse. That is what hell is. So? What about it? You accept
            it. Life is suffering. But who wants to admit that? What do you do in the face of suffering? You try to
            reduce it. You start with yourself. What good are you? You get yourself together so that when your father
            dies, you are not whining away in a corner and you can help plan the funeral standing up solidly so that
            people can rely on you. You can’t be a victim, because of course you are a victim. The answer to suffering
            cannot be more suffering. The answer to what may hurt you cannot be to hurt yourself even more in
            preparation of it. There most certainly are ways that you can act that make things really worse; this fact
            implies the existence of ways that you can act that make things really much better too due to the
            symmetrical nature of the universe we are lucky enough to be a part of.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are ways of “being” in the world that justify the world, and there are ways of being in the world that
            make the world unbearable. “Being” does require limitation and suffering, there is no escape from that, but
            there are modes of being that allow this to be bearable and good. We have a short time on earth, and it is
            worthwhile to find a mode of being that makes life bearable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each and every person in this world has their problems, and do not forget that society is a collective
            function of every individual’s effort. This makes it clear that despite the fact everybody has unimaginable
            problems, off they go to work and do things they do not even like, the result of which you may observe: the
            lights are on, electricity is working, you have water running through your pipes, the internet is working,
            there’s stuff to buy in the grocery store (in a non-covid-lockdown world). It’s a miracle.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the oldest story of mankind: get yourself together, transcend your suffering, see if you can be some
            kind of metaphorical hero, make the suffering in the world less. That is the way forward.
