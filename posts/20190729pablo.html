                Artistry often seems to have this strange proclivity towards being cryptic and sometimes even
                mysterious.
                However, art is a form of expression, so I do suppose this makes sense considering each individual has
                their
                own unique way of expression which might not be obvious to all observers initially. There are
                many
                artists I admire but few I understand in the truest sense. One of these artists who I think I actually
                understand is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West" target="_blank">Kanye West</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This realization came to me when I was listening to his song Famous from the album "The Life of Pablo"
                (2016). I noticed he added a hidden vocal layer that's barely audible after the beat drop at the 1:50
                mark.
                I will go on in more detail as we progress through this blog post.</p>
            <p>
                As song starts, you hear Rihanna (uncredited)
                sing the lyrics from the 1968 classic <a href="https://youtu.be/E4xde537g1A?t=20" target="_blank">Do
                    What You Gotta Do</a> by Nina Simone.
                The lyrics go as:
            </p>

            <div class="lyrics">

                Kind of hard to love a girl like me<br>
                I don’t blame you much for wanting to be free<br>
                I just wanted you to know<br>
                I loved you better than your own kin did<br>
                From the very start<br>
                It's my own fault for what happens to my heart<br>

            <hr>
            <p>
                This is a song from a woman hesitantly granting freedom to her man who has apparently grown distant from
                her. She is accepting that he would be better off on his own in search of liberty than to be felt forced
                into a relationship with her that would prevent the fruitful attainment of his full potential. From the
                way Simone sings these words, one can identify her sense of regret, disfavor, and anguish that has
                caused her to say them. It's almost as if she is does not want to say these words but is doing so after
                prolonged mournful thought on the matter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After the end of the intro, the song then transitions into its first verse which introduces a macabre
                vibe to the track with the inclusion of a sample from Rovescio della
                Medaglia’s 1973 piece <a href="https://youtu.be/GrKyFS-22w8?t=106" target="_blank">Mi sono svegliato
                    e…
                    ho chiuso gli
                    occhi</a> from the album Contaminazione di alcune
                idee de certi preludi e fughe del Clavicembalo ben temperato di J. S. Bach. Translated from Italian, it
                means "Contamination of some ideas of certain preludes and fugues of the well-tempered Clavier by J. S.
                Bach." This album explores pieces from Bach through a more modern perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this verse, we are acquainted with the infamous egotistical side of Kanye. The lyrics serve to
                suggest, rather vainly I might add, how Kanye is responsible behind some of his associates gaining fame.
                This is Kanye being Kanye, this was how he expressed his art before 2019. He does not fear to speak his
                mind. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let us jump to what fascinates me most about this track. There is a layer of audio placed in the
                song which is Kanye singing the verse to Nina Simone's <i>Do What You Gotta Do</i> instead of Rihana.
                This audio layer is placed so that it is eclipsed by the beat drop at <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq2TmRzg19k&feature=youtu.be&t=109" target="_blank">1:50</a>:
                <p>
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="../audio/bambamsample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>
                </p>


                You can hear Kanye's voice faintly underneath the sample of the song
                <a href="https://youtu.be/OcaPu9JPenU?t=34" target="_blank">Bam Bam</a> by Sister Nancy (1982).
                <p>
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="../audio/bambamoriginal.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>
                </p>
                As you may have been able to observe that in Kanye's track, he transforms <i>Bam Bam</i> to match the
                chord
                progression used by Simone's <i>Do What You Gotta Do</i>. 


                Kanye's voice only becomes fully audible at
                <a href="https://youtu.be/Lq2TmRzg19k?t=173" target="_blank">2:53</a>.
                <p>
                    <audio controls>
                        <source src="../audio/kanyeaudio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                    </audio>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I respect how Kanye sticks to his fundamental principle of <a
                        href="https://youtu.be/ZgJyhKEZ8QU?t=35" target="_blank"
                        title="Kanye, deconstructed: The human voice as the ultimate instrument by Vox">the human voice
                        being the ultimate
                        instrument.</a>. I find this to be a beautiful metaphor how the human voice is used as the
                    instrument that carries the song along its most lively part:
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_(music)" target="_blank">the
                        beat drop.</a> Here it is again for your listening pleasure:
                    <p>
                        <audio controls>
                            <source src="../audio/bambamsample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                        </audio>
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is one of the things I like in Kanye's songs, how he masks his voice underneath music,
                    sometimes even shouting, to say what he really means. This is showcased in some other songs of his
                    as well. My favorite one is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-FkJ5FzWgs"
                        target="_blank">Runaway</a> from 
                        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/20r762YmB5HeofjMCiPMLv?si=awjcch4kSm2vUh8R6lUyIg" target="_blank"><i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i></a> (2010). I am unwilling to share a
                        timestamp as this song is a masterpiece in its whole self and I would like to advise you to
                        experience it on your own. Another song that comes to mind is 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ0u09mFodw&feature=youtu.be&t=171" target="_blank">New Slaves</a> from 
                        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7D2NdGvBHIavgLhmcwhluK?si=wK0QTrDnRhuvWBgRubh9gQ" target="_blank"><i>Yeezus</i></a> (2013). Here is the sample in the song that starts at 2:51
                        I am referring to:
                        <p>
                            <audio controls>
                                <source src="../audio/newslaves.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                            </audio>
                        </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Famous</i> is an amalgamation of several timeless pieces of musical art throughout the decades.
                    When
                    thought about, the diversity of the pieces used is astounding, we have late 60’s jazz, we have
                    18th
                    century Bach brought back to life in the 1970’s, and we have reggae all tied up by modern hip
                    hop to
                    produce this 3 minute and 16 second piece of audio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This song is an amalgamation of several timeless pieces of musical art throughout the decades.
                    When
                    thought about, the diversity of the pieces used is astounding, we have late 60’s jazz, we have

                </p>
                <p>
                    It is sad that such pieces of art are overlooked because of the superficial controversy
                    surrounding
                    it. Maybe it was intended to be so, even when observing the album cover, one might question
                    regarding who would take an album seriously when it advertises a woman’s fake posterior so
                    explicitly? Who would take a song seriously when the lyrics start off with the singer stating
                    the
                    sexual possibilities with another artist in the most unsophisticated and falsely incentivized
                    way
                    possible?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I suppose we are used to turning our heads away when faced with the undesirable side of an artist to
                    appreciate the side that is relevant to us.
