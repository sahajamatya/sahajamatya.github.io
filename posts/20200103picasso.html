                Picasso is a personal plotter I built over the first half of my 2019 winter break that operates on the
                principle of Computer Numerical Control (CNC). It functions on three axes, with two NEMA 17 stepper
                motors controlling the X and Y axes to navigate the writing apparatus across the designated writing
                surface and an SG90 Micro Servo Motor allocated to control the Z axis serving to dictate the up and down
                motions of the writing apparatus. The digital inputs were distributed using an Arduino Uno paired with a
                CNC Shield. I used two A4988 drivers to manage the stepper motors for the X and Y axes.

                I decided to use an MDF board as the writing base because of its high density and smooth surface. I
                bolted the X-axis linear rail on to the board and fixed a stepper motor to control motion in that axis
                right next to it; I drilled 8 holes surrounding the footprint of the stepper motor so as it tie it in
                tight with 8â€³ zip ties. I placed the motor above a Styrofoam cutout to reduce noise. The Y-axis rail was
                mounted right on top of the X-axis slider using some welding glue. A 50mm wheel was attached to the
                other end of the Y-Axis rail to keep it balanced and a wooden plank (0.5â€³x2â€³x17â€³) was glued on to the
                MDF board right below the path of the wheel to keep the Y-axis rail perfectly level. I welded the Y-Axis
                Stepper Motor on one end of the rail. I 3D printed parts to act as mount for the timing pulley to go on
                opposite ends of each motor. I used Onshape as my CAD tool to design these parts.

                I used Inkscape v0.92.4 as my vector imaging tool. After finding the image I want, I trace the bitmap on
                the canvas, and then use the custom <a href="https://github.com/fablabnbg/inkscape-centerline-trace"
                    target="_blank">Inkscape Centerline Trace extension</a> to trace out a path to avoid
                outlining which would form multiple layers. I then convert the thus obtained object to a path and export
                the G-code for this image using the <a
                    href="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.106/k8u.855.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/MI-Inkscape-Extension.zip"
                    target="_blank">MIGRBL extension</a>. MIGRBL differs from regular GRBL in that MIGRBL is
                customized for CNC shields that have the X and Y axes connected to stepper motors with the Z axis
                connected to a servo (CNC Shields are almost exclusively built for stepper motors only). For single line
                fonts, I would recommend using the <a
                    href="https://gitlab.com/oskay/hershey-text/tree/master/hershey-text" target="_blank">Hershey Text
                    v3 extension</a> which should be included with the Inkscape
                package from v1.0 and above.

                <p><u>#1.1: Designing Strong Enough Parts</u><br>
                    Having no previous experience with either CAD or 3D printing, I was unaware of the limitations of 3D
                    printing. After designing all the required parts, I learned that the 0.188â€³ cylindrical mounts for
                    the pulleys would not be able to handle the stress generated by the tension of the timing belt. To
                    counter this, I added in a fillet around the base of the cylinder to provide some extra support as

                    As I started this project during my winter break, the 3D printing service station provided by my
                    university was out of operation. Third-party 3D printing services were charging astronomical sums
                    for such small parts which did not fit the budget I allocated for this project. Thankfully, I was
                    able to find a guy close to my city via the the subreddit <a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprintmything/" target="_blank">r/3Dprintmything</a> who did it
                    for me at
                    1/4th of the price third-party services were charging.

                <p class="audioDescription">Pic. (4): Isometric Projection of the Pen Holderâ€™s Final Design</p>
                <p>
                    As stated before, having no previous experience with CAD, coming up with a design for the pen holder
                    was a big challenge. I wanted to design something that was universal so that it could hold a writing
                    apparatus possessing any girth. I came up with two different versions of the pen holder with the
                    first one failing as it was too wobbly. When I had a final design, I was unable to have it move
                    along the Z-Axis as originally intended. I came up with a workaround to counter this problem. I
                    drilled a hole on the side of my pen, tied one end of a silver bead wire to the servo motor and the
                    other end to the end of the penâ€™s refill tube through the hole. When the servo motor simulated a
                    pen-down motion, rotating 90Â° to the left, it generated tension on the string which in turn pulled
                    the refill tube down. The pen-up movement was simulated when the servo motor returned back to its
                    initial position releasing all tension on the string.

            <span class="subsubHeadings">Challenge #2: Adjusting the Tension on the Timing Belt</span>
            <p>
                To explain this hurdle, let us observe the setup of the Y-Axis. I noticed the writing apparatus was
                missing a certain number of steps each time only when it was gliding through the negative Y
                direction. I came to realize that this was caused because the pulley on the motor was positioned
                slightly lower than the pulley on the 3D printed mount. This was a quick fix.

            <span class="subsubHeadings">Challenge #3: New Territory</span>
            <p>
                Being a pure Computer Science major, electronics is a field that feels very familiar yet in reality
                is tremendously different. I had never worked with Arduinos or PCBs before but comprehensive reading
                on all of the components helped me overcome this challenge.

            <p class="subHeadings">Things I Learned</p>
            <p>
                Things I learned working on this project with no prior engagement include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Arduino programming</li>
                <li>Programming motors</li>
                <li>G-code</li>
                <li>GRBL</li>
                <li>CAD</li>
                <li>Specifics of 3D printing</li>
                <li>Machine assembly</li>
                <li>Machine calibration</li>
                <li>Vector based image manipulation</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="subHeadings">Possible Further Developments</p>
            <p>
                As I work through my Computer Science Degree, Iâ€™d like to keep on building on Picasso and add machine
                learning capabilities to generate an acceptable bitmap image from any picture which can then be
                converted into a sketch-able vector file.

            <p class="subHeadings">What I Could've Done Better</p>
            <p>

                    target="_blank">flat linear rail</a> instead of the cylindrical one I purchased with my uninformed
                opinion would
                have immensely reduced the wobbliness I had to deal with while calibrating the Z-axis motion. I may
                upgrade to it in the future.
            </p>
            <p class="subHeadings">Some Miscellaneous Images</p>
            <p style="color:red">Here, I will be adding some images I took while building Picasso.</p>
            <p>
                This project was an absolute pleasure and I would be lying if I didnâ€™t say I enjoyed every second of it.
                I would like to build a knock pattern sensing door lock for my next project. Until next timeâ€¦
