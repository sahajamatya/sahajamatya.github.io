                What language do we think in? Is it the language we first learned? Is it a language we may have adopted
                later on? Is it a mix of both? Is it even a human language at all? Do we even use language to think? If
                we do, then to what extent? Is language just a mode of input for us that goes through a layer of
                translation to become something more abstract?
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine the times you’ve involved yourself in conversations that seek a relatively high degree of
                engagement. You dive down deep into each and every crevasse of your mind to scrape out bits of relevant
                information for the conversation. These types of conversations often demand a lot of thought. In
                conversations like these,
                you may have noticed yourself taking pauses at times in the course of speaking. Most of these pauses are
                induced because of 5 cases:</p>
            <p class="hangingIndent"><b><u>Case I:</u></b> You do not know what to say.</p>
            <p class="hangingIndent"><b><u>Case II:</u></b> You are overwhelmed with the number of things you could say.
                So, you
                have a hard time figuring out how to structure and/or link them together.</p>
            <p class="hangingIndent"><b><u>Case III:</u></b> You have forgotten what you were about to say.</p>
            <p class="hangingIndent"><b><u>Case IV:</u></b> Your pause is a reaction to what the other party said.</p>
            <p class="hangingIndent"><b><u>Case V:</u></b> You know exactly what needs to be said, but you just don’t
                know how to say
                it.</p>
            <p>
                Cases I through IV are quite trivial and occur due to obvious causes. I am more interested in the
                mechanics of a situation such as Case V.
            </p>
            <p>
                If human language is the only tool we use to construct thought, why, in situations such as Case V, would
                we be in search of words to communicate it? Allow me to further clarify; if we did use only words to
                think, wouldn’t what need be said in such situations already be present in the mind bearing a linguistic
                manifestation? This is how we may infer that human language is not the only tool in our mind’s arsenal
                which we employ to assist the mental process. Contrary to what Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig
                Wittgenstein (1889-1951) prosed, the limits of our language may not mean the limits of how we perceive
                our world.

            <p class="subHeadings">Employment of Symbolism in Language and its Significance</p>
            <p>
                Let us bring the second sentence of the second paragraph above into the spotlight:
            </p>
            <p class="quotation">
                "You dive down deep into each and every crevasse of your mind to scrape out bits of relevant
                information."
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice how little effort is required by the mind to understand what the sentence is trying to convey
                even though it is implying something other than its obvious and immediate meaning. In a literal sense, a
                crevasse has no relation to the mind. Yet, we are able to form a connection between them. I used a
                metaphor to symbolize how one might perceive the act of searching for information inside their mind,
                comparing it with how they might search for physical objects in a crevasse. It seems instinctual for us
                to develop such visual symbolic phrases when describing certain things. After all, our ability of sight
                is one of the first sources of inputs we rely on to make perceptual sense of the world, given that they
                are sufficiently functional. This is how the <i>animogn</i> is born, a mental representation of what has been
                perceived, is being perceived and/or can be perceived, when visual stimuli become memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Analogous to Chomsky’s theory of universal grammar where certain structural rules are innate to humans,
                our ability to form animogns is not limited by the history, quantity and/or quality of the visual
                stimuli we receive. To understand how, imagine,
            </p>
            <p style="display:none">
                I would like to include an analogy theoretical physicist, mathematician and string theorist <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Greene" target="_blank">Dr. Brian
                    Greene</a> articulated during his recent appearance on the <a
                    href="https://youtu.be/r4wQsmAtZoc?t=619" target="_blank">Joe Rogan Experience #1428</a>. At the
                00:10:19 mark,
                Dr. Greene mentions how we humans have very good intuition for space. Imagine somebody threw a
                bottle of
                water towards you. You would know how to catch it; you would know where to put your hands. You would
                not
                have to sit down with a pen, paper and a calculator to work out its Newtonian trajectory in order to
                precisely determine its location to know where you would be putting your hand to catch it.
                This is because our intuition and understanding of motion of such regular objects is learned from
                the
                visual stimuli we’ve received throughout our life. However, if someone were to throw a subatomic
                particle your way, say, an electron, you would not have a quantum intuition about the wave functions
                and
                probabilities that govern how a particle like the electron behaves. Since we are born as big
                creatures,
                our intuition and understanding were never under any evolutionary pressure to understand how
                electrons
                behave. In the similar way, we do not require effort to think in symbols as this ability is
                programmed
                into our psyche around the same time we develop consciousness, it is intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>A man climbing some stairs.</li>
                <li>19th century Dutch post-impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh climbing the same set of stairs.</li>
                <li>A refrigerator climbing the same set of stairs.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Chances are you’ve seen someone climb some stairs before. For (1), the man you imagined may not have had a face. The animogn you created in your mind for (1) may have been from memory. It could very well be the case that the entire animogn was not from one single event to refer from memory; the stairs might’ve been from your uncle’s house in Vienna, the details of the man might’ve been from of somebody who's never been to your uncle’s house, and the person’s gait might’ve been of somebody you knew. All these elements combined to give you (1). 
            </p>
            <p>
                For (2), I would bet good money that you have never received visual stimuli of van Gogh climbing stairs, yet you are able to picture him. Perhaps, you were able to substitute the faceless man you envisioned in (1) with van Gogh.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us take this a step further into absurdity with (3). It is farce to think of  an inanimate household object in voluntary self-induced motion. Yet, you are able to do so. Maybe you pictured it so that it had cartoon legs, maybe it was shimmying its way up, or perhaps it was gliding forward. A substitution in your animogn for the object you imagined in (1) and (2) climbing stairs allowed you to replace it with a refrigerator. So in reality, for all 3 cases above, your animogn contained a symbol for an object making its way up a set of stairs; for (1), you replaced the object with a person, for (2) you replaced it with van Gogh, and for (3) you replaced the object with a refrigerator. 
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Our proclivity to think in symbols is further evident when we look at history, religion and
                mythology.
                In his book <i>Man and His Symbols</i> (1964), Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung
                wrote how "man is unable
                to define a 'divine' being. When, with all our intellectual limitations, we call something 'divine,'
                we have merely given it a name, which may be based on a creed, but never on factual evidence." Jung
                further goes on to make the case how with divinity, being one of the innumerable things beyond the
                range
                of human understanding, we have found ways to use symbolic terms to represent them, and that is why
                all
                religions employ symbolic language or images. Groups of people, be it a country, a state, a city, a
                company or a club, have their way of using symbols to represent their identity too with the use of
                flags or logos.
            </p>
            <p>
                This symbolic way of thinking allows us to understand concepts which are inexpressible with human
                language.
