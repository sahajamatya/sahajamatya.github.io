            <p>
                What language do we use to entertain thought? Most people may answer this question pointing to their
                mother tongue, a human language, but when given a bit more gritty and granular consideration, one's
                position with respect to that answer may start becoming a little hazy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine you are engaged in a sufficiently intellectual conversation, you dive down deep into each
                and every crevasse of your mind to scrape out every bit of relevant information you can to add coherence
                and substance to what you are presenting to the listening party. While doing so, you may find yourself
                taking pauses at times to gather what you are about to say. As you have finished thinking, you have your
                argument in front of you and now you are searching for the correct selection and combination of words to
                use for maximum effect. If it were the case that you use absolutely nothing but the human language to
                construct thought, why would you be in search for words to describe it? You are trying to communicate
                what you think. If you did think in words, you would already have what need be said ready to be
                projected out through the mode of communication of choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us bring a portion of the first sentence from the previous paragraph into the spotlight:
            </p>
            <p class="quotation">
                "...you dive down deep into each and every crevasse of your mind to scrape out every bit of relevant
                information"
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice how no effort is required by the mind to decrypt what the sentence is truly trying to say even
                though it is implying something more than its obvious and immediate meaning. I used
                a metaphor to symbolize how one might perceive the act of searching for information inside their mind.
                It seems instinctual for us to develop such symbolic phrases when describing certain things. After all,
                when we are born, our sense of sight is one of the first sources of input we rely on to make sense of
                the world, given that they are sufficiently functional. Sure, we do have the sense of hearing too, but
                toddlers learn to react to vision-based stimulus earlier than they do to audio-based stimulus. An
                18-month-old baby would be able to recognize a four-legged animal walking towards them, although their
                brains may not be developed enough to determine if the situation is dangerous enough to kick into flight
                mode. Furthermore, the baby would be able to recognize the animal coming closer by seeing its image
                getting bigger and bigger as it approaches. In comparison, the same baby would not be able to decipher
                what “there’s a puppy coming your way”, or any other translation of the sentence means. The baby
                develops a mental model of the world through visual aspects first. Thus, a symbol is produced as the
                visual input turns into a memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would like to include an analogy theoretical physicist, mathematician and string theorist <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Greene" target="_blank">Dr. Brian
                    Greene</a> articulated during his recent appearance on the <a
                    href="https://youtu.be/r4wQsmAtZoc?t=619" target="_blank">Joe Rogan Experience #1428</a>. At the
                00:10:19 mark,
                Dr. Greene mentions how we humans have very good intuition for space. Imagine somebody threw a bottle of
                water towards you. You would know how to catch it; you would know where to put your hands. You would not
                have to sit down with a pen, paper and a calculator to work out its Newtonian trajectory in order to
                precisely determine its location to know where you would be putting your hand to catch it.
                This is because our intuition and understanding of motion of such regular objects is learned from the
                visual stimuli we’ve received throughout our life. However, if someone were to throw a subatomic
                particle your way, say, an electron, you would not have a quantum intuition about the wave functions and
                probabilities that govern how a particle like the electron behaves. Since we are born as big creatures,
                our intuition and understanding were never under any evolutionary pressure to understand how electrons
                behave. In the similar way, we do not require effort to think in symbols as this ability is programmed
                into our psyche around the same time we develop consciousness, it is intuitive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The way we think in symbols is further evident when we look at history -- religion and mythology to be
                more particular. In his book <i>Man and His Symbols</i> (1964), Carl Gustav Jung wrote how "man is
                unable
                to define a 'divine' being. When, with all our intellectual limitations, we call something 'divine,'
                we have merely given it a name, which may be based on a creed, but never on factual evidence." Jung
                further goes on to make the case how with divinity, being one of the innumerable things beyond the range
                of human understanding, we have found ways to use symbolic terms to represent them, and that is why all
                religions employ symbolic language or images. Groups of people, be it a country, a state, a city, a
                company or a club, have their way of using symbols to represent their identity too with the use of
                flags or logos.
