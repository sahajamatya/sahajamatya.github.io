      <p>Rickrolling, alternatively rick-rolling, is a prank and an Internet meme involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 Rick Astley song "Never Gonna Give You Up". The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the music video. </p><p>The victims, believing that they are accessing some unrelated material, are said to have been rickrolled. The trend has extended to disruptive or humorous appearances of the song in other situations, such as a live appearance of Astley himself in the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York.</p>
        <p>
          "Never Gonna Give You Up" appeared on Astley's 1987 debut album Whenever You Need Somebody. The song, his solo debut single, was a number-one hit on several international charts, including the Billboard Hot 100, Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, and the UK Singles Chart. The accompanying music video, Astley's first, features him performing the song while dancing.

  The song's eventual Internet popularity may be traced back to a 2005 episode of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, "Charlie Has Cancer", in which the song is used quite prominently. Rickrolling was reported to have begun as a variant of an earlier prank from the imageboard 4chan known as duckrolling. The director of the site, who went by the name "m00t," started replacing occurrences of the word "egg" on the site with the word "duck." When the word "eggroll" was turned into "duckroll," users started changing links to sensational pictures or news items so that they instead connected users to an edited picture of a duck with wheels; the user was then said to have been "duckrolled."
For a native English speaker who is learning a new language, say Chinese, s/he has to arrange the Chinese letters and symbols to make up words and then organize those words in the correct order to construct a sensible sentence. It's a puzzle of sorts.

Studies have concluded that the Chinese speakers rely more on vision whereas English speakers rely more on phonology. The argument of this hypothesis is that such a characteristic inevitably leads to a better development of the visual conceptualization and processing skills for Chinese speakers. (Source)

Language seems to be the only sector where this idea has been focused on. But of course, my undertaking is to show what other dimensions this theory can implicate.

  In a conversation with the subject, he mentioned how he disliked today's capitalist society, though he was very verbose in clarifying that by stating that, he in no way supported communist beliefs. He further explained that it wasn't much fun - the established system of spending the first third of your life in academics, the second third of your life working for money and the final third of your life waiting for death. He advocated how life could be much more wholesome if people would grow their own food, breed their own livestock and spend their spare time invested in the arts. Of course, the subject didn't think about the fact that if everybody adopted that approach, there would no one working in the field of medicine, clothing, and other fields of work borne by the advancement of civilization. But I did not dare correct him at that moment, for when I heard him say those words, I had my revelation.</p></span>
